	<h1>Overview</h1>
	<p>This is a angular single page app that works with my node server for serving out a log of work that I have done as well as serve as a location where I can upload new work that has been completed.</p><br>
	<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> <br>For my employer to search through tasks that I have done</p>
	<p><strong>Reason:</strong> <br>Doing it as my first Angular side project to get a better understanding of the MEAN stack</p>
